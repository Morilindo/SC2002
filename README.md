Hospital Management System Notes

I am still writing the skeleton of the code. Once that is done, you can write each User class without needing to write other things hopefully. Documentation is in the code itself.

## Note:

Date is now a comparable. You can use sort on date now.

## Need to write

1. MainApp - nc
2. Patient - lqx(trying)

   Stuck

   Methods need (in appointmentScheduler - LYX):

   (1) printAvailableList

   (2) printStatueList

   (3) printCompletedList

   done, and its STATUSLIST

   Can do: write patientAPPS, and doctorAPPS(similar to APPS), or delete print in APPS
3. Doctor - lqx(trying)
4. Pharamacist -
5. Administrator -
6. Schedule (d,31) - lyx
7. UserList (d,27) - nc

## TODO :

- [X]  Whoever is writing patient class, please finish the contructor of Medical Record
- [X]  Finish the constructor of Appointment Outcome Report
