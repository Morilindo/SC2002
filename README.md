Hospital Management System Notes

I am still writing the skeleton of the code. Once that is done, you can write each User class without needing to write other things hopefully. Documentation is in the code itself.

## Note:
Date is now a comparable. You can use sort on date now.

## Need to write
1. MainApp - nc
2. Patient - lqx(trying)
   Stuck
   Methods need (in appointmentScheduler - LYX):
   (1) printAvailableList
   (2) printStatueList
   (3) printCompletedList
   Can do: write patientAPPS, and doctorAPPS(similar to APPS), or delete print in APPS

4. Doctor -
5. Pharamacist - 
6. Administrator - 
7. Schedule (d,31) - lyx 
8. UserList (d,27) - nc 

## TODO : 
- [ done ] Whoever is writing patient class, please finish the contructor of Medical Record
- [ ] Finish the constructor of Appointment Outcome Report

### LYX
- [ ] DoctorScheduleManager
