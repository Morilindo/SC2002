Hospital Management System Notes

I am still writing the skeleton of the code. Once that is done, you can write each User class without needing to write other things hopefully. Documentation is in the code itself.

Need to write
1. MainApp - nc
2. Patient -
3. Doctor -
4. Pharamacist - 
5. Administrator - 
6. Schedule (d,31) - lyx 
7. UserList (d,27) - nc 

TODO : 
1. Whoever is writing patient class, please finish the contructor of Medical Record
2. Finish the constructor of Appointment Outcome Report
